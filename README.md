# The Pros & Cons of Test Driven Development
## Pros
1. TDD can make sure programmers write unit tests for their project code. Otherwise some casual programmers may tend to not write tests for their code.
2. TDD can elicit the requirement for a software, as each test can be perceived as a functional requirement for the product.
3. TDD seperates each requirement to a unit test, which can help programmer to make each part of the program more independent. It helps in terms of  single-responsibility principle.
