# The Pros & Cons of Test Driven Development
## Pros
1. TDD can make sure programmers write unit tests for their project code. Otherwise some casual programmers may tend to not write tests for their code.
2. TDD can elicit the requirements for a software, as each test can be perceived as a functional requirement for the product.
3. TDD seperates each requirement to a unit test, which can help programmer to make each part of the program more independent. It helps in terms of the single-responsibility principle.
4. The unit tests in TDD can be a good document for the code.
5. Doing TDD can let programmers fing bugs earlier.

## Cons
1. TDD means extra work for programmers. It requrires writing a lot of tests before formally start code projects, which means more workload.
2. The tests in TDD may not be thorough, so there may still be bugs; and since the code "passed" the tests, the bugs may be even harder to find out.
3. TDD needs time to implement, which may slow down the process of development.
4. Sometimes, we cannot transform a requirement into unit tests, because the requirement may be complex.
